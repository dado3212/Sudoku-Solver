# Sudoku Solver

### Web Version

This is a web version of the Python program that I wrote previously.  You can check it out at https://alexbeals.com/projects/sudoku.  This version includes an animated completion version, which while slower (especially on Sudoku's that it has to repeatedly guess on) looks much more interesting on standard puzzles.
